# Singletons

In Tink, client singletons are dead. Without a lifecycle,
controllers were just simple tables. This model can still
be used by returning a table with functions from modules.

In this guide we will be creating a very simple money
service. The entire service can be found at the bottom of
this page.

## Creating a Service

Creating services has been simplified in Tink. The only
argument passed to `CreateService` is the name of the
service.

```lua
local MoneyService = Tink.CreateService("MoneyService")
```

## Adding Serverside Functionality

Services are just tables, so adding functionality is very
simple.

To add a variable, just index it in the service.

```lua
MoneyService.PlayerMoney = {}
```

You can add functions and methods in the same way.

```lua
function MoneyService:GetMoney(Player)
	return self.PlayerMoney[Player]
end
```

## Adding Clientside Functionality

Adding clientside functionality has also been streamlined.
Firing remote events is very simple, you simply call the
method on the service.

::: tip
While invoking clients with a remote event is still not
advised, it is certaintly more safe than before, especially
because it returns an cancelable promise.
:::

```lua
function MoneyService:GiveMoney(Player, Amount)
	self.PlayerMoney[Player] += Amount
	self:FireTo(Player, "MoneyChanged", Amount)
end
```

Adding remote functions is very simple, and is very similar
to Knit.

```lua
function MoneyService.Client:GetMoney(Player)
	return self:GetMoney(Player)
end
```

::: tip
You probably noticed that while the function is in the
`Client` table, the `self` keyword still refers to the
service. This is because the `self` keyword is a reference
to the service, not the client table. To support the
transition from Knit, `self.Server` is still supported.
:::

Adding events follows the same process as remote functions.
In fact, remote functions and remote events are the same
thing. The only difference is that remote functions return
a value.

```lua
function MoneyService.Client:TransferMoney(Player, Target, Amount)
	self:GiveMoney(Target, Amount)
	self:GiveMoney(Player, -Amount)
end
```

::: info
When using remote events, it is very common to bind a single
function to the event, exactly like a remote function, just
without a return.

The process of adding events is the same as adding because
remote functions and remote events are the same thing. The
only difference is in the way that the client calls them.
When the client calls them as an event, the server doesn't
send the returns. When called as a function, the server
sends the returns.
:::

## Lifecycle Callbacks

Tink services have no lifecycle callbacks. This is because
there is no start function, as everything initializes
itself. It is impossible to have a service in Tink that
isn't ready.

As services are always ready, you can just call functions
on the service in the script that initializes it.

```lua
local Players = game:GetService("Players")

Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(Player)
	MoneyService.PlayerMoney[Player] = 0
end)

Players.PlayerRemoving:Connect(function(Player)
	MoneyService.PlayerMoney[Player] = nil
end)
```

## Using the Service on the Client

Retrieving services on the client is very simple. The
function does yield until the service is found. If the
service doesn't exist, then after 5 seconds the function
will warn.

```lua
local MoneyService = Tink.GetService("MoneyService")
```

To call remote functions, use the `Invoke` method. As remote
functions return values, calling this method returns a
promise that resolves with the returned value.

```lua
local Success, Money = MoneyService:Invoke("GetMoney"):await()
```

To call remote events, use the `Fire` method. This returns
nothing.

```lua
MoneyService:Fire("TransferMoney", Target, Amount)
```

To listen to events on the client, you can use the same
method as on the server. Just add a function to the client
service's `Client` table.

```lua
function MoneyService.Server:MoneyChanged(Amount)
	print("Money changed by", Amount)
end
```

However, because it is very common to attach multiple
listeners to events on the client, client service objects
extend the `Emitter` class. This means that you can use
the `On` method to listen to events.

```lua
MoneyService:On("MoneyChanged", function(Amount)
	print("Money changed by", Amount)
end)
```

## Full Example

### Server

```lua
local Tink = require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage").Packages.Tink)

local MoneyService = Tink.CreateService("MoneyService")

MoneyService.PlayerMoney = {}

function MoneyService:GetMoney(Player)
	return self.PlayerMoney[Player]
end

function MoneySerice:GiveMoney(Player, Amount)
	self.PlayerMoney[Player] += Amount
end

function MoneyService.Client:GetMoney(Player)
	return self:GetMoney(Player)
end

function MoneyService.Client:TransferMoney(Player, Target, Amount)
	self:GiveMoney(Target, Amount)
	self:GiveMoney(Player, -Amount)
end

local Players = game:GetService("Players")

Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(Player)
	MoneyService.PlayerMoney[Player] = 0
end)

Players.PlayerRemoving:Connect(function(Player)
	MoneyService.PlayerMoney[Player] = nil
end)
```

### Client

```lua
local Tink = require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage").Packages.Tink)

local MoneyService = Tink.GetService("MoneyService")

local Success, Money = MoneyService:Invoke("GetMoney"):await()

MoneyService:Fire("TransferMoney", Target, Amount)

function MoneyService.Server:MoneyChanged(Amount)
	print("Money changed by", Amount)
end

MoneyService:On("MoneyChanged", function(Amount)
	print("Money changed by", Amount)
end)
```
